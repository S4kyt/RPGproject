### Project Overview:
Date: 2018.11.01

This is my very first program I created as a hobby.
Its "terrible" but at the same time I rly like it.

I wanted to leave all my old repos on my GitHub because not one of us starts out as someone who knows everything.
This project is my real life example to show how much I improved over the years.
